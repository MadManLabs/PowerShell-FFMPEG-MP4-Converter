# PowerShell-FFMPEG-MP4-Converter
A PowerShell based script that utilizes FFMPEG to convert a video to MP4

## Usage
Download ffmpeg.exe and place it in the same directory as the script and run the script from PowerShell.

## Disclaimer
I am still learning PowerShell and some basic work with how to interact with GUI's and I was experimenting with FFMPEG to create this simple thing. It is not perfect as such :)
